# Replying to Recruiters

## Scheduling

One of the first questions you'll get from them of course is when you're available to talk/video chat/whatever.

I personally use [Calendly](http://calendly.com) for this process and it works wonders.

I'd recommend trying it out yourself since it's free.

## Email Template

Here's a reply template you can use to follow up.

```markdown
Hi [Name of recruiter]

Thanks for reaching out - I'm very excited to learn more about [Company Name]

So in terms of setting up a time to chat, I actually have a Calendly where you're more than welcome to see when I'll be available this week or next.

Looking forward to hearing back!
